description:

A lexical analyzer, also known as a lexer or tokenizer, is an essential component in a compiler or interpreter. It scans an input source code to break it into tokens—small units like keywords, operators, and identifiers—so that the compiler or interpreter can process them further. In this C program, we will build a simple lexical analyzer that identifies and classifies keywords, operators, and identifiers from an input file.

Program Structure


The program will work by reading an input file, scanning its content, and categorizing each part of the content (like keywords, operators, and identifiers) into separate categories. Let's first define the components we need:

1.Keywords: These are reserved words with predefined meanings, such as if, else, while, return, etc.


2.Operators: These include symbols like +, -, *, /, and =, used for arithmetic and logical operations.


3.Identifiers: These are user-defined names, typically variables or function names, following specific rules.

Approach

Input: The program reads an input file containing source code.


Tokenization: The program will break down the source code into tokens by identifying the type of each token (whether it's a keyword, operator, or identifier).


Classification: Each token is then classified into one of the categories: keywords, operators, or identifiers.
